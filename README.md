## Introduction

---

This Tortoise Race game was built as part of required projects for application to Founders And Coders.\
The project is a race between multiple tortoises which move from one side of the screen to the other.
A user can start a race, see the race results, add new tortoise racer, change their name, color and speed.

## The game instructions

---

- Start the game \
  Click the button 'Start'

- View and change a tortoise name, color and speed \
  Click the tortoise you interested on.
  This will open a modal that shows tortoise properties and availability to change them.\
  Note, that you can't change a tortoise properties while the race is in progress.

- Game result display\
  After the game is finished the result will be displayed on the screen.
  The tortoises' speed will be randomized automatically.

- Create a new tortoise \
  the name should be at least 2 characters long, \
  the color should be the valid color the browser supports with formats (color names, rgb, hex, hsl), \
  the speed range is 1 to 10

## Technical

---

The game is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The main index.js is the external script that has type module.  
In the index.html

```
 <script src="./index.js" defer type="module"></script>
```

Exporting module features and importing features is done by using import and export declarations. \
Modules where used for maintainability, reusability and to avoid name conflict. \
The start game function calls built in browser setInterval() function to execute the race. \
Each tortoise is an instance of Tortoise functional constructor.

## How to run

---

Clone github project to your local folder using command \
`git clone https://github.com/nataliarusu/tortoise_race.git`

To run the project use a server because JavaScript module syntax was used in this project.

- To run the project using VScode:

  Open the project in VScode and click to 'Go Live' from the status bar to turn the server on/off _OR_ right click on a HTML file from Explorer Window and click on Open with Live Server

- To run from command line:

  - install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
  - run command
    > npm install --global serve
  - ater serve installed run command
    > serve

  Now your local directory is hosted in localhost. Open in your browser suggested url. Usually it defaults to http://localhost:3000

  **serve** is a NPM package that converts your current working directory into an virtual directory i.e. the directory is hosted under localhost.

## Functions

---

`renderTortoise()` calls `tortoise.render()` method and creates new line for tortoise in the field.

`startGame()` updates the field's right position and runs `setInterval()` which will run every 100ms.
While setInterval is running, each `tortoise.move()` method is called until the turtle's right position matches the field's right position.

`tortoise.move()` method changes tortoise's left position by adding speed value to the current left position.
When all tortoises' right position is equal to the field's right position `clearInterval()` triggers.

`finishGame()` displays the result of the race in the modal. The close button's event listener handler function resets
all tortoises position, randomize tortoises' speed, and activates the start button, so a new game could be started.

`changeProperties()` displays a form with tortoise's properties that could be changed.

`saveChanges()` function calls different validate functions to validate inputs value. If the values are valid it calls tortoise methods to set the new values to tortoise object.

## Faced challenges

---

- I started writing code in one index.js file.
  The deeper I went into my project, the messier it got.
  It was so hard to keep track of that so I decided to split it into many js files and use modules.
- I decided to create each tortoise as an instance of the Tortoise functional constructor, not class-based.
  Each tortoise should have methods and it was obvious I should create Tortoise.prototype. \
  The render() method creates tortoise HTML element. But if the user changes some tortoise properties, render() will create a new tortoise HTML element and won't update the existing one. \
  To resolve it I added a new method rerender(), which changes the style of the existing tortoise HTML element.

- How should I check if all tortoises completed race? \
  A tortoise can move(), can stop(), and be aware it has finished the race. Should I go through the tortoises array and check each tortoise's completedJourney property each time the move() method is called in setInterval()?
  Even if I choose this approach, how to check which tortoise finished first? \
  I decided to create another object, with a result property and add tortoises in the order they completed the race. \
  This gave me the chance to avoid multiple iterations over the tortoises array and render the trophy straight away above the tortoise that won the game before the game was finished.
- I also had some difficulties with click events and animations.

In this project, I did not handle the case of many turtles having the same speed.
